# 404-Found-App

**404 Found** is a mobile app designed to provide optimized travel routes by car, MARTA, bike, and foot.

The system will be used by anyone, student or not, who is traveling to the GSU campus and needs to find an optimal route to campus. The software will be designed to be easy and intuitive for efficient and non-distractive use while the user is on-route.
